The Passenger 2.2.11 RPM packages referenced in Chapter 4 are available online
at:

 * http://yum.puppetlabs.com/prosvc/

These packages are not officially supported by Puppet Labs.  I built them to
effectively manage passenger using RPM packages rather than having to build the
native C extensions on every system I was working with during my consulting
engagements.

The repository location may change in the future.  If the above URL is no
longer valid, please ask about these packages in #puppet on freenode or the
puppet-users mailing list.

Thanks,
