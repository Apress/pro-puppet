# The standby certificate authority will use a different certificate authority directory
# since we're running both the primary and the secondary on the same host.
# We recommend running the primary and secondary CA on two different machines which
# will allow both to have the same filesystem path configured.  The primary system should
# periodically replicate itself to the secondary.
